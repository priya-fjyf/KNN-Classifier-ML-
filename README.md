# KNN-Classifier-ML-
Practice project using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python with scikit-learn. Includes basic classification, data visualization, and explanation of how KNN works.
## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm Project
This repository contains a practical implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using Python. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step code, explanations, and visualizations to help understand how KNN works.

## Files in this repository
'KNN-Classifier.ipynb' — Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the KNN algorithm with sample data.
'dataset.csv' — Dataset used for training and testing the model.
About KNN Algorithm
## About K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It classifies new data points based on the majority class among its 'k' nearest neighbors in the feature space.

## How to use
1. Download files(jupyter notebook and dataset)
2. Open notebook in Jupyter
3. Run cells step-by-step to see KNN in action
4. Modify the notebook or dataset as needed for experimentation.
## Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
